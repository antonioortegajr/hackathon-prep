# Challenges and Technologies

## Goals

The overall goal is to set up challanges for success. By considering the technology that would need to be employed we can avoid potential pitfalls that could derail a project after the hack.

## Types of tech employed

Generally challenges fall into just a few combinations of technologies:

1. Websites 
2. Native mobile applications
3. Services
4. Databases
